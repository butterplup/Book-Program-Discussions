                            <p>It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may be doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society 
                                of his surviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but his thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call 
                                indeed; but he was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart, he preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep 
                                and surrounded by the air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into that house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and 
                                speak with its inscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to communicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than 
                                ever confined himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very 
                                silent, he did not read; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. Utterson became so used to the unvarying character of these 
                                reports, that he fell off little by little in the frequency of his visits...</p>
