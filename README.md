# Book-Program-Discussions
A high-fidelity prototype for a fictional book-share program where members borrow books from the organisation. Made using html, css, and js.

The purpose of this prototype is to focus on design decisions for a basic landing page, and registration form for a postive user experience including considerations for accessibillity in design. Additionally, this prototype helped to teach me basic html, css, and javascript.
